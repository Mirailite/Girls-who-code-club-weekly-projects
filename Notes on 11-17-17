Events:
riot game - eventbrite in Dec 14, 4-7
Code day- Feb
Project Android Phone App
    -Have simulator online
Tiffany Ho began the meeting 
-dicussed code day with Carlin 

Project Ideas:
-Math prime numbers 
-input text morse code 
-poker card- chance to win 
-clothes (the way to see how yourself look) 
-input frequency 
-input music notes - to determine the best harmony based on frequency 
-fix posture(maybe by beep)
-do our homework
-robot assistant= blimp 
-spanish words which conjugates 
-emulator 
-check police dring by 
-remind where you parked (app)
-remind someone to do something (app)
- stay productice 
- when os a good time to take a break

pesudo code:
Purpose: visually without worrying about compling and know what we are building 
Reference:
  -Variables, loops, conditionals, functions, operator 
    # options that we have

Subject of sudo code:
Morse code 
# ideas: Output string of sound and light , what output do you want like an output light and a flashlight

Definitions
light = 0
sound = 1
control_string()
output_sound()
output_Light()

sound of light = get_user_input();
string int word = get_user_message();
volume = get_prefered variable();

if(sound or light)  {
  morse_light convert_string()
  # do something
 }
else(sound or light) {
set_volume()     # there may be something wrong here 
# do something 
output_sound(morse_sound)
}

Speaker: Dr.Helga Farjadi 
  -study the human visual system
  -played Prince of persia 1999
  -mostly used pascal,c
 
Study of vison loss
Forea- dyfunctional 
-macular dieses(MD) : usually gentics runs from the family

How does vison loss influence eye movement?
-study patient 
  -confronting factors in a slow process 
  -provide pardigm similuating vison in loss healthy people 
  
 -usage of eye tracker machine
 -1. used the by collecting data on from the eyes
 -2. coding implement task 
 3. coding for anaylzing data 
 
 Code used is matlib 
  - gives the toolbox - to let the eyecatcher communicate 
  - subject targeting task in movement 
  -understand what eyemovement  and help them to understand
  
 Study of shorterm memory 
-by performing a visual search 
-VSIM - temporary searcg 
how do you allocate?
  - the more items you have to memorize it becomes sufficiently bad 

sudo code of shorterm memory 
# small bit of it 
num_item = 2;
# 2,4 How many items it must have 
if( num items ==2){
  x1 = 0;
  y1 = 100;
  x2 = 0;
  y2 = -100;
 plot eclipse( x,y)
 }

if( num items == N){
  for(1 = 1 for n) 
    x=_
  plot eclipse( x,y)
  }
