#What we learned today in Girls who code-a recap...
# A review on Variables, Operators and conditionals statements 

#Michael our instructor started the lesson by saying random numbers and told us to add them together in addition.
Random numbers 
# Michael our instructor told us that whenever we are stuck in a code, use sudo code for it.
Sudo code is used like a text editor, and a way to program and solve problems in code easier.
# Pseudocode- this is the accurate spelling for sudo code
22 1 4 12 16 72 43 -20 4 6 = 160
1.First we need to know how to implicit using the variables and operators 
2.Second, define a variable. 

Ex: { int num1=22;
      int num2=1;
      int num3=4;
      "
      "
      "
# quotations are the coutinution of the variables
# this is like an analog
      }

int ans=num1+num2
    if( ans==160)
    
Excercise 1: Robot arm 

# think of the robot arm from the crang game 


#we start with a height of 100cm;
int claw_height=100cm;
#away arm to move down 
# alien is the object in the crang game for the robot arm to get 

int alien_height=5;
#usually use the void in arduino
     loop()

   { 
   if(claw_height> alien_height)    # when we use operators
   `    move.down1();
        close_close();
     if claw_height=close_height
     close_claw();
     move_to_100();
     exit();
     break;
     }
     
Excercise 2: Traffic Light 
 
 Red Yellow green
 
 light_on   
      red_on; off 
      green_on; off 
      yellow_on;off 
   
 # why do we need a time because without time, how are the drivers are waiting for the light. The whole streets and pedestrians would 
 mess up.
 Code:
 const int delay_time=60;
 const int yello_int=5;
 
 loop
 {
   yellow_off();
   green_off();
   red_on();
   delay(delay_time);
   red_off();
   green_on();
   # don't include cause in the beginning was already included yellow_off();
   delay(delay_time);
   green_off();
   yellow_on();
   delay(yellow_time);
   
  }
   
Excercise 3: to get the numbers in the beginning of the lesson to add up together 
  int sum=0;
  # we need to a get a number so we name a function called get_num()
  get_num();
  
  loop
  {
  int num=get_num();
  int sum=num+sum;
    print(sum);
  if(sum=right_answ) got_prize()
  }
   
   Excercise 4: Fibonacci Sequence 
   int num = 0;
   int num 2 = 1;
   int sum=0;
   
   loop
   { sum= num + num 2
      print(num2) # instead of sum 
      `           # it's almost like the swap code thing
      num=num1;
      num2=sum;  
      # if change the   num=num1; and  num2=sum;  would have a iteration change of the of Fibonacci sequence.
  
  This is what we learned today in coding.
